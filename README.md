# 20_Small_Projects
These are the small projects that I am going to do just to practice HTML, CSS and JS. I am following a tutorial here so basically these are not unique but I am aiming that by doing these I will get my hands dirty and will learn by doing things not falling into tutorial hell and after this will start making my own projects
